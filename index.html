                                    <p>This project, which I completed with a classmate during Year 2 Semester 1,
                                        simulates a coffee drone navigating through a maze to reach an endpoint via the
                                        shortest path. Using the NetworkX library for graph-based pathfinding, we were
                                        able to model the maze as a graph and calculate the optimal route efficiently.
                                        This experience significantly strengthened my understanding of data structures
                                        and algorithms.</p>
                                    <p>We equipped the drone with several interactive features, including the ability to
                                        pause, stop, and calculate the shortest path to the goal. The NetworkX library's
                                        pathfinding algorithms were instrumental in implementing the shortest path
                                        calculation. The drone can also be controlled manually, with built-in collision
                                        detection to prevent it from clipping through walls or obstacles, ensuring a
                                        realistic simulation.</p>

                                    <p>I developed a Deep Learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
                                        classify 15 different types of vegetables. By leveraging the CNN’s ability to
                                        learn spatial hierarchies of features, the model is able to recognize unique
                                        patterns and textures in each vegetable class, making it highly effective for
                                        image-based classification tasks.</p>
                                    <p>The CNN architecture I implemented allows the model to automatically detect
                                        features such as shapes and edges that distinguish each vegetable.
                                        Training the model involved processing a large set of labeled images, where the
                                        CNN iteratively learned and refined its feature-detection capabilities. This
                                        project enhanced my understanding of deep learning and computer vision
                                        techniques, and it was exciting to see the model accurately classify such a
                                        diverse set of classes.</p>

                                    <p>In this project, I conducted a retail analysis of HDB flat resale data using
                                        Tableau. The goal was to visualize trends and patterns in the resale market to
                                        gain insights into price fluctuations, demand distribution across different
                                        locations, and factors influencing resale values.</p>
                                    <p>The analysis included visualizations of resale price trends over time,
                                        comparisons across flat types and locations, and price distributions base on
                                        amendities. This project deepened my understanding of data-driven
                                        decision-making in
                                        the real estate market, as I explored how variables like location, flat size,
                                        and lease years impact resale prices. Tableau’s interactive capabilities allowed
                                        stakeholders to filter and drill down into specific insights, making the
                                        analysis both insightful and user-friendly.</p>
